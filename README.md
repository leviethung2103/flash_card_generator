```bash
pip install python-docx
pip install openpyxl
```

## How to use

1. Open ```Input_Data.xlsx``` 
2. Fill **Column A** with the text that you want to see on each card's **top side**
3. Fill **Column B** with the text that you want to see on each card's **bottom side**
4. When you are done save the file
5. Run ```flash_card_generator.py``` script
6. When the script is done a new file called ```Printable_Flash_Cards.docx``` will appear in the root folder
7. Open the freshly generated .docx file, make sure it is exactly what you wanted
8. Print the document as doublesided

*Note: Currently the ```Input_Data.xls``` is filled with example data, english phrasal verbs. Source: https://www.skypeenglishclasses.com/english-phrasal-verbs/*

### Content of the generated file

The generated output file (Printable_Flash_Cards.docx) has the following parts:
1. Cover page
2. Printable cards
3. A summary table with the content of every flash card.

### Bulk changing the style of the cards

If you want to change the font, size etc. of the cards at once you can do easily by modifying the pre-define Word Style called: "Normal".

### File names

Change the default file names with the help of the below global varables:

```python
INPUT_FILE_NAME     = 'Input_Data.xlsx'
TEMPLATE_FILE_NAME  = 'Template.docx'
OUTPUT_FILE_NAME    = 'Printable_Flash_Cards.docx'
```

## TODO

### New features

- [ ] Make card dimensions modifyable. Currently it can be reduced but every page will consist of 12 cards.
- [ ] Make the number of cards on a single page modifyable.

### Known bugs and errors
